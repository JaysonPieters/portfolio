                            <p class="card-text">Since I knew from the start I'd be making most of the game, I wanted it to be as modulair as possbile. Since we had quite a big scope, making everything modulair was the only hope of getting even close to making everything within the time limit. At first I tried to make a lot of things modulair, but that was costing me quite a bit of time, which I didn't have a lot of anymore. So quite a few things where not as modulair anymore as I wanted.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">This project was made in 8 weeks, in a team. The team consisted of 3 artists and 2 developers. 1 artist quit early on because he had a personal problems, and the other developer didn't really contribute to the project, dispite us pushing them to do something. This made it so I had to make the entire game, playtest it and fix bugs. Thankfully the playtesting part was made easier due to it being released on itch.io, so I asked friends to test the game for me. But dispite my best efforts, I ran out of time and a few bugs still remain in the game, like the UI not scaling correctly. And due to the time constraint, alot of planned features where scrapped, like more 2 more classes and worlds, more abillities, shops and an actual ending with bossfight.</p>
